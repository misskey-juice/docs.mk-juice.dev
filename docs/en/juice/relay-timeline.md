# Relay timeline

A dedicated timeline that only shows notes received via registered relay servers.

## What's included

- Only public-visibility notes received via a relay are included. Followers-only, direct, etc. are not included.
- Notes received before a relay was added are not included.

## How to use it

You can view it by selecting "Relay" from the timeline switcher. As with other timelines, new notes appear in real time.

Each note shows which relay (host) it was delivered through.

## Using it in Deck

You can also choose the relay timeline from the type selector when adding or editing a "Timeline" column in the Deck UI. Each column can be filtered by a different relay.

## Display for visitors who are not signed in

Whether visitors who are not signed in can see the relay timeline follows "Visibility of user-generated content to guests" under "Moderation" in the Control Panel. Since every note that arrives via a relay is a remote note, it is shown only when the setting is "Everything is public"; with "Only local content is published, remote content is kept private" or "Everything is private", nothing is shown.
